# UWPsychDemo
Materials for UW Psych Department Demo on March 5 2020

## Prerequisites
For those of you who want to follow along, please install the following software (preferably in this order):

1. Please install Git: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Please install R: [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
3. Please install RStudio: [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
4. Please install a visual GitHub Interface. For cross-operating system compatibility, I recommend Fork: [Fork](https://git-fork.com/). It is currently available for free on Mac and Windows. If you use Linux, then you don't need a GUI and/or can figure this out on your own.

## Files
### README.md
That's me! It is the default file that Git will look to for information about a project.

### R files
Within the scripts directory, you will find some simple R scripts for creating and analyzing data. We will be working with these to demonstrate how to use GitHub through RStudio.


### .gitignore
All the files on the local computer that should not be tracked by Git. RStudio will automatically generate a number of rules for standard R files that should not be included in the global repository (e.g., .RData files).

##Troubleshooting
###RStudio GitHub Integration
